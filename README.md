## API 

PropTrac's `API` was built in `C#` with the `ASP.Net Core` framework following `Model-View-Controller` (MVC) architecture, and was deployed using Microsoft's PaaS `Azure App Service`.

- Endpoints were developed for the **internal team**.
- Base URL: https://proptracapi.azurewebsites.net

> [!NOTE]
> Please reference the documentation developed in `Postman` for specific endpoints/ requests.
